# Online Resume System

## Spring 2015

### Description

In this project, you will design and implement an RDBMS to support the operations of an **on-line job/resume posting service**. 

The basic idea behind your on-line job/resume posting service is that it will allow job seekers to post their resumes on your web site, companies to post descriptions of job openings, and job seekers and companies to browse/search the contents of your database (at least that part you want them to see). 

Job seekers can use the web site to set up an interview with a perspective employer and, likewise, companies can use the web site to set up an interview with a perspective employee. Your system will also allow job seekers to attach an image of themselves to their resumes.

### Specifications / Requirements:

- The users of your system will be:
    - Job seekers who upload their resumes to your web site
    - Companies (recruitment personnel) who upload descriptions of job openings 
    - Various employees of your web site: customer representatives who arrange interviews and provide other customer-related services, and the web site's manager. 

The data items required for your database can be classified into six categories: 
- resumes
- companies
- job categories
- job descriptions
- interviews
- employees (of the web site).

This classification does not imply any particular table arrangement. You are responsible for arranging the data items into tables, determining the relationships among tables and identifying the key attributes. 

You should include indices in your tables to speed up query processing. You should base your choice of indices on the type and expected frequency of the queries. Finally, you should specify and enforce integrity constraints on the data.

You will create your relational model using Mysql Workbench or Phpmyadmin Designer.

### Transaction Support

#### Manager Transactions:

* Add, Edit and Delete information for an employee
* Obtain a sales report for a particular month
* Produce a comprehensive listing of all job seekers and companies
* Produce a list of interviews by job seeker name, company name, or by job description
* Produce a summary listing of revenue generated by a particular job seeker, company, or job description
* Determine which job description generated most total revenue, and which customer representative generated most total revenue
* Determine which job seeker or company generated most total revenue
* Produce a Best-Sellers list of job descriptions
* Determine the most popular company, in terms of number of interviews requested, for a particular job category

- The manager is responsible for creating and maintaining the classification hierarchy of job types. 
- When a new job description is received from a company, the manager must decide into which category to place the job description, and create a new category if necessary.

#### Customer Representative Transactions:

* Add, Edit and Delete information for a job seeker or company
* Produce customer mailing lists
* Produce a list of job suggestions for a given job seeker (based on that job seeker's past interviews)

- The customers of your web site, i.e. job seekers and companies, should be able to easily browse your web site and and perform downloads and request interviews. 
- While a customer will not be permitted to access the database directly, he or she should be able to retrieve useful information. 

Job Seekers should be able to retrieve the following:

* Customer account information
* Job descriptions by a given company
* Job descriptions of a particular type
* Job descriptions with a particular keyword or set of keywords in the title
* Best-Seller list of job descriptions
* Personalized job-description suggestion list

Companies should be able to retrieve the following:

* Customer account information
* Resumes of a particular job type
* Best-Seller list of resumes
* Personalized resume suggestion list

Your database system should provide controlled access to the data by distinguishing between the different types of users: 
- manager
- customer representatives
- customers

* Customer Representatives should not be able to perform manage-level transactions; however, they should be able to read employee information, except for the hourly rate.
* Customer Representatives should be able to record an interview.
* A customer should not be allowed to access other customers' account information, or to any employee information.
